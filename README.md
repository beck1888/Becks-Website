## About
This is my side project, hosted on a RaspberryPi that's currently sitting on my bedroom bookshelf. Please read the homepage of this app for full details.

At some point, I intend to write more formal documentation, a roadmap, and a to-do; but right now I'm focusing more on development than documentation. Also, I've tried to follow Python best practices and proper code formatting, but I'm sure I could always do a better job!

If you want to help me with this, or anything else, I would really appreciate it! Please feel free to open an issue, PR, or fill out the contact form on the site. Also, I'm new to writing readmes (can you tell)? I pretty much just looked around on different GitHub repos and included aspects of their READMEs that seem relevant on this one. If this README is overkill or to harsh or formatted incorrectly or missing something or really has any issues or anything of that sort, please feel free to help me fix it. Like I said, this is my first time writing and deploying a project like this, so I'm sure I have plenty to learn, and any help in that direction would be greatly appreciated!

### Funding
This project is completely self funded. Most of it was free (aka I already owned the hardware). My only real operating expense are API keys. Right now I have $5.00 loaded onto the OpenAI api set up to not auto-reload, so if errors with api keys come up that is probably the cause. I can fund it more, but I'm trying to keep costs low because this is a side project.

## Installation

You can use this project at: [http://beck.asuscomm.com/](http://beck.asuscomm.com/)

OR

Follow these steps to set up the project on your own machine (Mac/Linux; similar for Windows):

1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to the project root.
3. Create the Streamlit configuration files:
    ```sh
    mkdir .streamlit && cd .streamlit
    touch config.toml secrets.toml
    ```
4. Add the following to `config.toml`:
    ```toml
    [server]
    headless = true

    [theme]
    base = "light"

    [browser]
    gatherUsageStats = false
    ```
    Save the file.

5. Add your OpenAI API key to `secrets.toml`:
    ```sh
    nano secrets.toml
    ```
    Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here`

6. Navigate back to the project root and run:
    ```sh
    streamlit run üè†_Home.py
    ```
7. Visit [http://localhost:8501/](http://localhost:8501/)

Protect your API keys by adding a password screen if deploying publicly via the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or another hosting method (e.g., RaspberryPi and port forwarding as I‚Äôm doing).
